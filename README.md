# AstroPic
My implementation of Karin Prater's AstroPic iOS app. 

Watch and support on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS_XrFyX8Bk&t=0s

This app connects to NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day Archive and displays the picture for the chosen day with the date, title and description.

The app was build using SwiftUI and MVVM architecture.
